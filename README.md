### Goal

This is a website to download free arabic PDF books. I coded this project to practice on my knowledge HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, PHP, and MySQL in a real project.

> For front-end design only (HTML - CSS - JavaScript), navigate the Front-End directory in the source code.

### Benefits

Here are some ideas to benefit from this project:

- Take this project as a task and try to make it, and if you could not do a specific section, see how I make it in the source code (use comments to reach this section).
- Extract a code of a specific section and use it in your project.
- Review source code to see how other people code their projects.
- Edit on this project after studying its code well, to know how to work in pair-programming with other people
- Upgrade this project, and add your own sections or pages

### Installation

Here are the guidelines to run this project on your localhost:

1. Download, then install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) web server
2. Download this project, then rename its folder to `pdfbooks`
3. Copy the `pdfbooks` folder to the `htdocs` folder which exists in XAMPP installation path
4. Start XAMPP control panel from your Desktop, then start `Apache` web server, and `MySQL` server
5. Open your browser, and type `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`, to open PHPMyAdmin home page
6. Create a new database with the name `pdfBooks`

5. Open your browser, and type `http://localhost/pdfbooks`, to open the main page of the website
6. Navigate to `http://localhost/pdfbooks/dashboard`, to open admin dashboard of the website

> **Important Note:** The `php.ini` file has a maximum allowed size for uploaded files = 2mb, so if you upload a book more than 2mb it will not be uploaded. To avoid this change the `Maximum allowed size for uploaded files` in the `php.ini` to whatever you want.
